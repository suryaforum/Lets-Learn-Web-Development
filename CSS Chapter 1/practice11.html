    <h1>Iron Man</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Iron Man is the superhero persona of Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark, a
      businessman and engineer who runs the weapons manufacturing company Stark
      Industries. When Stark was captured in a war zone and sustained a severe
      heart wound, he built his Iron Man armor and escaped his captors

    <h2>Publication History</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Iron Plot Tony Stark, who has inherited the defense contractor Stark
      Industries from his late father Howard Stark, tours in war-torn
      Afghanistan with his best friend and military liaison, James "Rhodey"
      Rhodes, to demonstrate the new "Jericho" missile. After the demonstration,
      his convoy is ambushed by a terrorist group, the Ten Rings, and Stark is
      gravely wounded by a missile used by the attackers—one of his company's
      own. He is captured and imprisoned in a cave by the Ten Rings. Yinsen, a
      fellow captive and doctor, implants an electromagnet into Stark's chest to
      keep the shrapnel shards that wounded him from reaching his heart and
      killing him. Ten Rings leader Raza offers Stark freedom in exchange for
      building a Jericho missile for the group, but he and Yinsen believe that
      Raza will not keep his word.

      At a charity event, reporter Christine Everhart informs Stark that his
      company's weapons were recently delivered to the Ten Rings and are being
      used to attack Yinsen's home village. Stark dons his new armor and flies
      to Afghanistan, where he fends off the terrorists and saves the villagers.
      While flying home, Stark is intercepted by the Air Force. He reveals his
      secret identity to Rhodes over the phone to end the attack. Meanwhile, the
      Ten Rings gather the pieces of Stark's prototype suit and meet with Stane,
      who has been trafficking arms to the Ten Rings and has staged a coup to
      replace Stark as Stark Industries' CEO by hiring the Ten Rings to kill
      him. He subdues Raza and has him and the rest of the group killed. Stane
      has a massive new armor suit reverse-engineered from the wreckage. Seeking
      to track his company's illegal shipments, Stark sends Potts to hack into
      its database. She discovers that Stane hired the Ten Rings to kill Stark,
      but the group reneged when they realized they had a direct route to
      Stark's weapons. Potts meets with Agent Phil Coulson of S.H.I.E.L.D., an
      intelligence agency, to inform him of Stane's activities.

    <h3>Solo Series</h3>
    <p>
      Stane's scientists are unable to duplicate Stark's miniaturized arc
      reactor, so Stane enters Stark’s home and steals the one from his chest.
      Stark manages to replace it with his original reactor. Potts and several
      S.H.I.E.L.D. agents attempt to arrest Stane, but he dons his suit and
      overpowers them. Stark fights Stane but is outmatched without his new
      reactor to run his suit at full capacity. The fight carries Stark and
      Stane to the top of the Stark Industries building, where Stark instructs
      Potts to overload the large arc reactor powering the building. This
      unleashes a massive electrical surge that causes Stane to fall into the
      reactor and he is killed in the explosion. The next day, at a press
      conference, Stark publicly admits to being the superhero the press has
      dubbed "Iron Man".

    <h2>Fictional Character</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man: An industrialist, genius
      inventor, and playboy, he is CEO of Stark Industries and chief weapons
      manufacturer for the U.S. military. Director Jon Favreau felt that
      Downey's past made him an appropriate choice for the part[9] and that the
      actor could not only make Stark a "likable asshole," but also portray an
      authentic emotional journey, once he had won over the audience.[10]
      Favreau was also attracted to Downey because of his performance in Kiss
      Kiss Bang Bang. Downey frequently spoke with that film's director, Shane
      Black, about the script and dialogue in Iron Man.[11] Downey had an office
      next to Favreau during pre-production, which allowed him greater
      involvement in the screenwriting process,[12]
